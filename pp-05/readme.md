# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://cameronmoll.com/downloads/Web_Accessibility_Checklist.pdf
2. https://cs.unibg.it/verdicch/usability_checklist.pdf

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Navigation labels are clear and concise
2. Site has a custom 404 page
3. Do not use JavaScript events that radically alter the page or load a
  new page when fired.
4. Whenever possible, write descriptive headings and link texts 
  which can be understood when read out of context (e.g. no “click
  here” links)
5. Be sure each element on a page is reachable and can be
  manipulated via the keyboard.
6. Separate structure from presentation and use proper markup for
  that structure. For example, mark up lists as lists (<ul>, <ol>, <dl>) rather
  than text with a <br> tag after each list item.
7. Styles and colors are consistent
8. Main navigation is easily accessible
9. Company logo is linked to homepage
10. Home-page is digestible in 5 seconds
