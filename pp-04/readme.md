# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:


* HCI Guidline Three (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-style
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The areas on the My IIT login page are 
  not designed for a touch friendly environment. The clickable items or the items
  that need to be clicked are designed for a computer's mouse to navigate to the area
  and click. The main purpose of the first page is to login to IIT's portal.
  To keep the purpose cleat and concise, I created two inputs for username and password.
  I also created a simple login button that will be at least 44px.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html#color-color-system
* How you implemented it in your sketch: My IIT's website lacks any true color correlations
  indicate to a user where their eye's should be going. So adding simple color and a background can help user's
  pin point the main focus of the page which is the login area and its inputs.
  The background image can be the a blured out picture of Chicago thats on the website,
  and adding a simple border will lure user's eyes towars the login area.
